# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Going from completely workable to completely accessible
As busy modern worker bees, it's easy to jump from one project to the next in a hurry to keep the productivity we all need and crave. Part of this leads to creating websites that are perfectly fine, beautiful even, but doing so in a way that is quick & efficient. Unfortunately doing things quickly can lead to missing things that make our websites better for accesibiliy. This can include

>- Semantic HTML
>- logical structure
>- alternate attributes for images
>- Sequential header ordering
>- Descriptive titles

Each of these items is easy to miss when coding in the moment. That is why for this exercise I have gone through and addressed the items above. Replacing abstract ```<div>```s with more descriptive semantic tags such as ```<section> <main> <header>```. Making sure the structure of the HTML is sound, like proper indentations and headers at the top of sections regardless of styling. Adding ```<alt>```properties to images to make sure all can get a feel for the images. Adjusting headers so they are nested correctly, and flow from highest ```<h1>``` to lowest ```<h4>```. Lastly, making sure the title of the pages is descriptive as possible.

## Scouts honor
In addition to Acceptance criteria, it is always a good idea to clean up the code as much as possible. In this regard, making sure the anchor links in the nav bar are all working correctly. Also removing redundent css, and consolidating classes or removing them where appropriate.

## Usage 

If you feel the need, go ahead and download the example files and refactor further if you wish.
